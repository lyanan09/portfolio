            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                A fake video diary of mine. Using camera and AR as tools, documenting small stories of my life. The
                stories are fake,
                the feelings are real.

            <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>

            <p>
                I wanted to use this project to get familiar with 3d and AR, so I started thinking about how to interact
                with these tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by a comedy piece by Bo Burnham[1], in which he interacts with himself as an in-game character
                on a controller.
            </p>
            <!-- if you have a full width image try make it not too tall -->
            <img src="../assets/images/bo.png" />
            <p>
                The interaction doesn't actually happen, but through video editing, the audience can feel the confusion
                by standing between the reality and the virtuality.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three kind of entities involved in the AR interaction: people, devices (phones, tablets,
                etc.), and
                virtual objects. I want to try to
                interact directly with virtual objects across devices. Although the interaction itself will not
                actually happen, the audience can watch the interaction between the real me and the virtual objects on
                the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final work is a video of several small stories. I conceive the stories from the things around me and
                the
                3D models I can
                find, thinking about what the models are, how to use them, and how to fill the real space, and how I can
                interact with
                these models. Due to time limits, it ended up consisting of the following two clips:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I really like Pringles: A story about my obsession with Pringles, but I can only afford one.</li>
                <li>I think I need a dog: A story about being too lonely and needing a dog, but never getting
                    response from it.</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- <p>
                The audience sees me interacting with the virtual objects, making it difficult to tell whether it's real
                or virtual,
                but
                it requires higher technical expertise. The audience sees me trying to interact with the virtual
                objects, but not
                getting a response. Both of these narratives are possible, but due to time constraints, I choose the
                second one.
            </p> -->

            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <h5>Selection of device:</h5>

            <p>

                The final form of work is a video, which is recorded from the screen of the AR
                device. However,
                mobile AR requires the use of apps (chrome/XRviewer), which capture low resolution video by accessing
                the
                phone's camera. To improve the video quality as much as possible,
                I tried the
                following ways:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Recording the screen with a phone</li>
                <li>Connecting the phone to a computer and recording the phone screen on the computer</li>
                <li>Recording the screen with an iPad Pro</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The third was the best. Therefore, I decided to use an
                iPad Pro as the AR
                and recording device.
            </p>

            <h5>Technical Development:</h5>

            <p>Started from the AR drag example provided by three.js[2].</p>

            <p>
                I want two main ways to manipulate virtual objects: dragging and
                zooming in/out.
                This allowed me to place the 3D models in the right place at a right size.
            </p>

            <p>
                The dragging solution is already there, but there is no "pinchmove" in the event listener provided by
                WebXR. Although it is possible to implement the pinchmove event based on the squeeze event,
                it is not
                easy
                to squeeze an iPad Pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                So my final solution is to save the current object when it is touched, listen to the touchmove event,
                and scale the selected object when the event fires.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, I try to differentiate between treating technology as a goal and as a
                tool. Previously, I often mistakenly treated technology as a goal, which limited my creative process.
                And also I
                am learning to
                think about how to tell stories through video editing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to the low resolution of the final work, it doesn't look well on a big screen. There are two
                reasons for this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Limited device screen size</li>
                <li>The app accesses the camera with very low resolution.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Future Development:</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>A better title</li>
                <li>More stories</li>
                <li>
                    Searching for solutions to the problem of low resolution and exploring methods of
                    storytelling that do
                    not rely on screen recording.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consider more ways to interact, such as virtual objects respond after a person does something in a video.
                </li>
            </ul>
